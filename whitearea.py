Here’s the complete white area filter code for both Demand Zone and Supply Zone. You can paste this directly into your strategy's code where the zone validation happens.

Complete White Area Filter Code:





# Demand Zone White Area Filter (legout_open >= boring_candle_body)
def apply_white_area_filter_demand(stock_data, legout_index, boring_candle_index):
    # Calculate the body of the boring candle
    boring_candle_body = abs(stock_data['Close'].iloc[boring_candle_index] - stock_data['Open'].iloc[boring_candle_index])
    
    # Get the opening price of the legout candle
    legout_open = stock_data['Open'].iloc[legout_index]
    
    # Apply white area filter for demand zone
    if legout_open >= boring_candle_body:
        return True  # Filter passed
    else:
        return False  # Filter failed

# Supply Zone White Area Filter (legout_open <= boring_candle_body)
def apply_white_area_filter_supply(stock_data, legout_index, boring_candle_index):
    # Calculate the body of the boring candle
    boring_candle_body = abs(stock_data['Close'].iloc[boring_candle_index] - stock_data['Open'].iloc[boring_candle_index])
    
    # Get the opening price of the legout candle
    legout_open = stock_data['Open'].iloc[legout_index]
    
    # Apply white area filter for supply zone
    if legout_open <= boring_candle_body:
        return True  # Filter passed
    else:
        return False  # Filter failed





Integrating the Filters in Your Main Code:
For Demand Zone:

# Assuming 'i' is the index of the legout candle and 'i-1' is the boring candle
if scan_demand_zone_allowed and (stock_data['Close'].iloc[i] > stock_data['Open'].iloc[i]):
    # Apply the white area filter for demand zone
    if apply_white_area_filter_demand(stock_data, i, i-1):
        # Continue with your existing zone validation logic
        first_legout_candle_body = abs(stock_data['Close'].iloc[i] - stock_data['Open'].iloc[i])
        first_legout_candle_range = (stock_data['High'].iloc[i] - stock_data['Low'].iloc[i])
        
        if first_legout_candle_body >= 0.5 * first_legout_candle_range:
            condition_met = True
        else:
            condition_met = False
    else:
        condition_met = False


For Supply Zone:



# Assuming 'i' is the index of the legout candle and 'i-1' is the boring candle
if scan_supply_zone_allowed and (stock_data['Open'].iloc[i] > stock_data['Close'].iloc[i]):
    # Apply the white area filter for supply zone
    if apply_white_area_filter_supply(stock_data, i, i-1):
        # Continue with your existing zone validation logic
        first_legout_candle_body = abs(stock_data['Close'].iloc[i] - stock_data['Open'].iloc[i])
        first_legout_candle_range = (stock_data['High'].iloc[i] - stock_data['Low'].iloc[i])
        
        if first_legout_candle_body >= 0.5 * first_legout_candle_range:
            condition_met = True
        else:
            condition_met = False
    else:
        condition_met = False



How to Use:
Copy and paste the apply_white_area_filter_demand and apply_white_area_filter_supply functions into your code.
Use the respective function calls inside the zone validation logic for demand and supply zones.
This code ensures that the white area filter is applied properly based on the zone type (demand or supply).

How to Integrate This Filter:
Identify the indices for the legin, legout, and boring candles in your strategy.
Apply the TR vs ATR Filter within the zone validation logic.
Here’s an example of how you can apply this filter during zone validation:

Integrating Into the Zone Validation:
python
Copy code
# Assuming 'legin_candle_index', 'legout_candle_index', and 'i-1' (boring_candle) are already identified

# Apply the TR vs ATR filter
if apply_tr_vs_atr_filter(stock_data, legin_candle_index, i, i-1):
    # Proceed with the rest of the validation (like white area filter and ATR checks)
    condition_met = True
else:
    condition_met = False
Explanation:
legin_candle_index: Index of the legin candle (before the base).
i: Index of the legout candle (breakout candle).
i-1: Index of the boring candle (small base candle).
This will ensure the filter checks that TR > ATR for legin and legout candles, and TR < ATR for boring candles






To implement the **"formation of legout"** validation, we need to calculate the range of the **legin** candle and compare it to the opening price of the **legout** candle. The condition will vary for demand and supply zones:

- **Demand Zone**: The legout's opening price should not be more than **twice the range** of the legin.
- **Supply Zone**: The legout's opening price should not be **less than twice** the range of the legin.

If the conditions are violated, we'll filter out such zones.

### Here's how to implement this validation in Python:

1. **Calculate the Range of the Legin Candle**:
   The range of the legin candle is the difference between its **high** and **low** prices.
   
2. **Apply the Validation for Demand and Supply Zones**:
   - **Demand**: If the legout's opening price is more than twice the legin's range, filter it out.
   - **Supply**: If the legout's opening price is less than twice the legin's range, filter it out.

Here’s the Python code to add this validation:

```python
def validate_formation_of_legout(zones):
    validated_zones = []

    for zone in zones:
        legin_high = zone['legin_high']
        legin_low = zone['legin_low']
        legout_open = zone['legout_open']
        zone_type = zone['zone_type']  # 'demand' or 'supply'
        
        # Calculate the legin range
        legin_range = legin_high - legin_low

        # Validation for demand zone
        if zone_type == 'demand':
            if legout_open <= 2 * legin_range:
                validated_zones.append(zone)
            else:
                print(f"Filtered out demand zone: {zone['symbol']} (Legout open too high)")

        # Validation for supply zone
        elif zone_type == 'supply':
            if legout_open >= 2 * legin_range:
                validated_zones.append(zone)
            else:
                print(f"Filtered out supply zone: {zone['symbol']} (Legout open too low)")

    return validated_zones
```

### Explanation:
- **legin_range**: The difference between the **high** and **low** of the legin candle.
- **Demand Validation**: If the legout's opening price is **more** than twice the legin range, it's filtered out.
- **Supply Validation**: If the legout's opening price is **less** than twice the legin range, it's filtered out.

### How to Integrate This:
You can call this `validate_formation_of_legout` function in the part of your code where the zones are being processed before further analysis (e.g., backtesting or displaying).

Example usage:

```python
zones = [
    {'symbol': 'AAPL', 'zone_type': 'demand', 'legin_high': 150, 'legin_low': 140, 'legout_open': 285},
    {'symbol': 'TSLA', 'zone_type': 'supply', 'legin_high': 700, 'legin_low': 680, 'legout_open': 1390},
    # Add more zones here
]

validated_zones = validate_formation_of_legout(zones)

# Now, validated_zones contains only the zones that passed the "formation of legout" validation
```

- If you need any changes or further explanation, feel free to ask!








               To implement the **"wick in legin"** validation, we need to ensure that the **legin candle** has a wick. The wick is the part of the candle outside of the body (i.e., the difference between the high/low prices and the open/close prices). The condition will apply to both supply and demand zones.

### Logic for Wick Validation:
- **Upper Wick**: If the **high** price of the legin candle is greater than the **close** price in a **demand zone**, or greater than the **open** price in a **supply zone**, there is an upper wick.
- **Lower Wick**: If the **low** price is lower than the **open** price in a **demand zone**, or lower than the **close** price in a **supply zone**, there is a lower wick.

### Code Implementation:

```python
def validate_wick_in_legin(zones):
    validated_zones = []

    for zone in zones:
        legin_open = zone['legin_open']
        legin_close = zone['legin_close']
        legin_high = zone['legin_high']
        legin_low = zone['legin_low']
        zone_type = zone['zone_type']  # 'demand' or 'supply'

        # Check wick for demand zone
        if zone_type == 'demand':
            upper_wick = legin_high > legin_close  # Upper wick in demand
            lower_wick = legin_low < legin_open    # Lower wick in demand

            if upper_wick and lower_wick:
                validated_zones.append(zone)
            else:
                print(f"Filtered out demand zone: {zone['symbol']} (No wick in legin)")

        # Check wick for supply zone
        elif zone_type == 'supply':
            upper_wick = legin_high > legin_open   # Upper wick in supply
            lower_wick = legin_low < legin_close   # Lower wick in supply

            if upper_wick and lower_wick:
                validated_zones.append(zone)
            else:
                print(f"Filtered out supply zone: {zone['symbol']} (No wick in legin)")

    return validated_zones
```

### Explanation:
- **legin_open, legin_close, legin_high, legin_low**: These represent the open, close, high, and low prices of the legin candle.
- **Upper and lower wick checks**:
   - **Demand Zone**:
     - **Upper Wick**: `legin_high > legin_close` (there’s a wick above the body).
     - **Lower Wick**: `legin_low < legin_open` (there’s a wick below the body).
   - **Supply Zone**:
     - **Upper Wick**: `legin_high > legin_open`.
     - **Lower Wick**: `legin_low < legin_close`.

Zones that do not have a wick (either upper or lower) will be filtered out, and those with wicks will be added to `validated_zones`.

### How to Use This Validation:

```python
zones = [
    {'symbol': 'AAPL', 'zone_type': 'demand', 'legin_open': 140, 'legin_close': 145, 'legin_high': 150, 'legin_low': 138},
    {'symbol': 'TSLA', 'zone_type': 'supply', 'legin_open': 700, 'legin_close': 690, 'legin_high': 710, 'legin_low': 680},
    # Add more zones here
]

validated_zones = validate_wick_in_legin(zones)

# Now, validated_zones contains only the zones that passed the "wick in legin" validation
```

### How to Integrate:
You can call this function in your existing code where the zones are being processed, similar to how the "formation of legout" validation is applied.

Would you like help integrating this validation into your existing workflow or modifying your current code to accommodate both validations? Let me know!










To implement a **"buffer" validation** that adjusts the **entry** and **stop-loss** based on a percentage of the **Daily Average True Range (DATR)**, we will allow custom input for the buffer percentage. This validation will prevent stop-losses or missed entries due to market volatility.

### Buffer Logic:
1. **Entry Buffer**: Adjust the entry price by adding or subtracting a percentage of the DATR.
   - For **demand zones**, the entry will be reduced by the buffer to catch entries in volatile markets.
   - For **supply zones**, the entry will be increased by the buffer.
   
2. **Stop-loss Buffer**: Adjust the stop-loss price based on a buffer to avoid getting stopped out due to volatility.
   - The buffer will be added to or subtracted from the stop-loss.

### Implementation:

```python
def apply_buffer(zones, datr, buffer_percent):
    validated_zones = []

    for zone in zones:
        entry_price = zone['entry_price']
        stop_loss_price = zone['stop_loss_price']
        zone_type = zone['zone_type']  # 'demand' or 'supply'

        # Calculate buffer based on DATR
        buffer_amount = (datr * buffer_percent) / 100

        # Apply buffer to demand zones
        if zone_type == 'demand':
            adjusted_entry = entry_price - buffer_amount  # Buffer to reduce entry price
            adjusted_stop_loss = stop_loss_price + buffer_amount  # Buffer to widen stop-loss
            
            zone['adjusted_entry'] = adjusted_entry
            zone['adjusted_stop_loss'] = adjusted_stop_loss
            validated_zones.append(zone)

        # Apply buffer to supply zones
        elif zone_type == 'supply':
            adjusted_entry = entry_price + buffer_amount  # Buffer to increase entry price
            adjusted_stop_loss = stop_loss_price - buffer_amount  # Buffer to widen stop-loss
            
            zone['adjusted_entry'] = adjusted_entry
            zone['adjusted_stop_loss'] = adjusted_stop_loss
            validated_zones.append(zone)

    return validated_zones
```

### Explanation:
1. **datr**: The **Daily Average True Range** for the stock, which is used to calculate the buffer.
2. **buffer_percent**: The percentage of DATR to be used as the buffer (custom input).
3. **Adjusted Entry/Stop-loss**:
   - **Demand Zones**:
     - The entry price is reduced by the buffer amount to improve chances of entry during volatility.
     - The stop-loss is increased by the buffer amount to avoid premature stop-outs.
   - **Supply Zones**:
     - The entry price is increased by the buffer amount to avoid missed entries.
     - The stop-loss is reduced by the buffer amount to avoid stop-outs.

### Example Usage:

```python
zones = [
    {'symbol': 'AAPL', 'zone_type': 'demand', 'entry_price': 140, 'stop_loss_price': 135},
    {'symbol': 'TSLA', 'zone_type': 'supply', 'entry_price': 700, 'stop_loss_price': 720},
]

datr = 10  # Example Daily ATR value
buffer_percent = 5  # User can input the buffer percentage, e.g., 5%

buffered_zones = apply_buffer(zones, datr, buffer_percent)

for zone in buffered_zones:
    print(f"Symbol: {zone['symbol']}, Adjusted Entry: {zone['adjusted_entry']}, Adjusted Stop Loss: {zone['adjusted_stop_loss']}")
```

### Integrating Custom Input for Buffer:
In your **user interface**, you can allow the user to input a custom buffer percentage. Here's how you might add that to your existing setup:

```python
buffer_percent = float(input("Enter buffer percentage (e.g., 2 for 2%): "))

# Apply buffer to the zones with the user-defined buffer percentage
buffered_zones = apply_buffer(zones, datr, buffer_percent)
```

### Next Steps:
- **Integrate into the existing strategy**: Add this validation right before backtesting or when defining entries and stop-losses.
- **Customizable Buffer Input**: Allow the user to set the buffer percentage dynamically based on market conditions or preferences.
